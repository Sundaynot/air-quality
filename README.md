Air Quality Analysis and Forecast in Six Cities.
This project analyzes hourly air pollution data and forecasts the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning models. The goal is to understand pollutant trends (CO, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, PM2.5, PM10) across six cities ( Brasilia, Cairo, Dubai, London, New York and Sidney) and develop predictive tools to anticipate poor air quality events.
